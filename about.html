Some of my earliest memories are of me watching a film and saying
to myself, “I want to be that.” No, not the web-slinging superhero, but
the director that put the film together. Ever since then, videography
has been of my passion. However, that list has expanded over the
years. I enjoy going for long walks, seriously. There is nothing like
waking up early, grabbing my gear, and heading to the hiking trail for
the sole purpose of capturing photos of local wildlife. Some of those
photos are featured in this portfolio.
I can solve a rubik’s cube within ten minutes. I know, that isn’t impressive at all, but thankfully my problem solving abilities are far
more efficient when it comes to computer programming. I’ve always
been fascinated by people able to describe businesses using logos,
colour schemes, and typography. Used in web and graphic design.
The cleverness in digital marketing never fails to amaze me; that
 inspiration helps me with by graphic and website designs.
